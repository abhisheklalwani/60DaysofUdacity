#60DaysofUdacity<br></br>
The repository contains my logs of the 60 Days of Udacity challenge undertaken by me as a part of Secure and Private AI challenge by Udacity. As a part of the challenge, we were supposed to devote atleast 30 minutes daily towards learning of Udacity-based AI content as well as other relevant material.<br></br>
I initially kept these logs in a Google doc. I plan to port the content properly to this github repository in the near future.<br></br>
Until then, here is the link for the Google doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYd8lN-PdWrDP9y4BDXGYzv_hA2aQOVPiFqBRilQwIc/edit#heading=h.mqb4ag5eqg7z<br></br>
P.S.- It starts from day 9 because the logs for earlier days were posted in limited Slack workspace making the earlier updates irretrievable.<br></br>
