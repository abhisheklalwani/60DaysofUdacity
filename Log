Day 42:
Had yet another Physical meetup with @Abhishek Tandon. We were playing FIFA and got around to discussing how possibly Reinforcement Learning is used to develop the AI part of the game! The discussion which followed was about how we can use AI for the betterment of entertainment and gaming sector! Being from NVIDIA, the discussion was really interesting and relatable for me!

Irrespective of all this, I will be forever grateful for this experience, for my having met my amazing fellow scholars and the amount of development opportunities this community provided to me and to all my fellow scholars!
